In this module the if, else and while statements will be practiced
## Projects
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing (file: 0-positive_or_negative.c)
	- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

	- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game (file: 2-print_alphabet.c)
	- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. alphABET (file: 3-print_alphabets.c)
	- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using only putchar function
4.  When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off (file: 4-print_alphabt.c)
	- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all except q and e using only the putchar function.
5. Numbers (file: 5-print_numbers.c)
	- Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6. Numberz (file: 6-print_numberz.c)
	- Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. Use only the putchar function.
7. Smile in the mirror (file: 7-print_tebahpla.c)
	- Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. Use only the putchar function.
8. Hexadecimal (file: 8-print_base16.c)
	- Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. Use only the putchar function.
9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success (file: 9-print_comb.c)
